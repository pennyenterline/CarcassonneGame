# CarcassonneGame

Carcassonne is a classic board game, where you place tiles on a grid to build a city.

Implemented two new classes in python and used them to create the board for a Carcassonne Game. Able to follow roads and return coordinates of the tiles along the way, connect different tiles in grids, trace cities and see if they connect, and more.
